# Zero Forcing Number
This program calculates the zero forcing number (and set) of any graph. The zero forcing number is defined as follows: "A subset S of initially infected vertices of a graph G is called forcing if we can infect the entire graph by iteratively applying the following process. At each step, any infected vertex which has a unique uninfected neighbour, infects this neighbour. The forcing number of G is the minimum cardinality of a forcing set in G," according to [Kalinowski, Kamƒçev, and Sudakov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10391).
